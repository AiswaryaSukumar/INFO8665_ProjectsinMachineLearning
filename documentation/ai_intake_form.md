# INSIGHT-311 — AI-Generated Intake Form (Use Case 1)
**Purpose:** This form is generated by INSIGHT-311 during a live 311 phone call.  
It captures a structured, decision-ready service request for agent review, confirmation, routing, and ticket creation.

---

## 1) Why this form exists (DSS framing)
Traditional online forms require citizens to select the correct category and fill the correct path.  
INSIGHT-311 supports a voice-first workflow where speech-to-text + NLP proposes a category with confidence scoring, confirms details with the caller, and generates the appropriate structured intake form.

**This is decision support, not automation replacement.**  
Final authority remains with municipal staff through confirmation and escalation rules.

---

## 2) AI Intake Category Taxonomy (Use Case 1)
The prototype supports the following operational categories optimized for voice descriptions:

1. Graffiti / Vandalism  
2. Pothole / Road Damage  
3. Missed / Delayed Garbage Pickup  
4. Recycling / Organics Collection Issue  
5. Bulk Item Pickup Issue  
6. Sidewalk Snow Clearing  
7. Sidewalk Trip Hazard  
8. Streetlight / Traffic Signal Issue  
9. Parking Complaint (Non-emergency)  
10. Property Standards Complaint  
11. Needles / Hazardous Waste  
12. Trail / Park Maintenance  
13. Fallen Tree / Branch  
14. Water Leak / Flooding  
15. Unknown / Needs Human Review (safety valve)

## 4) Category-Specific Extensions (dynamic fields)
INSIGHT-311 expands the form based on the predicted/confirmed category.
These sections mirror the progressive disclosure seen in municipal online forms, but are AI-assisted.

---

### 4.1 Graffiti / Vandalism — Extension
**Fields**
- Graffiti_Location_Context: City property / Park or trail / Private property / Not sure
- Structure_Type: Wall / Fence / Sign / Playground equipment / Other
- Where_On_Structure: (free text)
- Photo_Available: Yes / No (prototype: caller can email later)
- Offensive_Content_Flag (optional): Yes / No (if Yes → escalate for priority handling)

**Routing Note (prototype)**
- If "Private property" → guidance message may be provided (policy dependent)
- Otherwise → create standard ticket

---

### 4.2 Missed / Delayed Garbage Pickup — Extension
**Fields**
- Collection_Type: Garbage / Recycling / Organics / Unknown
- Scheduled_Day (optional): (Mon–Sun)
- Items_Set_Out: Yes / No / Unknown
- Items_Acceptable (caller claims): Yes / No / Unknown (prototype)
- Missed_Or_Delayed: Missed / Delayed / Unknown
- Repeat_Issue_This_Month (optional): Yes / No / Unknown

**Routing Note (prototype)**
- High-frequency category optimized for quick intake
- Typically no photo required
- Can trigger duplicate detection later (Use Case 2) if multiple neighbors report same street

---

### 4.3 Pothole / Road Damage — Extension
**Fields**
- Surface_Type: Road / Bike lane / Parking lot / Unknown
- Size_Estimate (optional): Small / Medium / Large
- Safety_Hazard: Yes / No / Unknown
- Near_Intersection: (if known)
- Vehicle_Damage_Reported: Yes / No (if Yes → possible priority)

**Routing Note (prototype)**
- If Safety_Hazard = Yes and confidence high → prioritize queue
- If confidence low → agent review required

---

### 4.4 Sidewalk Snow Clearing — Extension
**Fields**
- Sidewalk_Location: (address or nearest intersection)
- Adjacent_To: Residential property / Commercial property / City facility / Unknown
- Time_Since_Snowfall (optional): <24h / >24h / Unknown
- Ice_Hazard: Yes / No / Unknown
- Mobility_Risk_Flag (optional): Yes / No (supports accessibility lens)

**Routing Note (prototype)**
- In many municipalities, snow clearing may route to property standards by policy
- INSIGHT-311 flags and routes automatically after confirmation

---

## 5) Output Artifact (what the system produces)
After confirmation:
- A structured ticket payload is generated (see `api-schema.md`)
- A governance record is written (see `governance-logging.md`)
- If escalated: the human agent takes over and finalizes category/routing

---

## 6) Example (filled snapshot)

**Confidence:** 0.86  
**Transcript:** "My garbage wasn’t picked up today. It’s still outside at 55 King Street."  
**Caller Confirmed:** Yes  
**Ticket Created:** Yes
